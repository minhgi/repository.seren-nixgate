        """Pulls GET /sync/watched (offset/limit-paginated per mdblist.apib - the
        response's pagination object has no cursor/next_cursor field, only
        offset/limit/has_more; a prior version of this method assumed a cursor
        that never existed, so pagination always silently stopped after page 1).

        Every page is collected into memory first; movies and episodes are
        each reset and repopulated as a unit only once pagination has cleanly
        finished (has_more went false). A page fetch failing mid-loop raises
        ActivitySyncFailure before any table is touched, instead of leaving
        either table wiped with only a partial repopulate.

        Movies were previously always empty due to a nesting bug (reading
        m["ids"]["tmdb"] instead of m["movie"]["ids"]["tmdb"], which meant
        every real entry failed its own tmdb-id filter) - now fixed. Live-
        confirmed 2026-07-18 against a real account (417 movies returned,
        correctly nested) that MDBList's API does populate this endpoint's
        movies list, so - like episodes - movies are now reset before
        repopulating: this is a complete paginated fetch of current server
        state, not a delta, so a clean-finish reset+repopulate reflects
        reality, and it makes a movie removed/unmarked on MDBList (or a
        cross_sync push whose local write got skipped, see cross_sync.py)
        self-healing on the next sync instead of a permanent local phantom.
        A locally-authored write (write_watched_locally(), scrobbler/context-
        menu) can be transiently overwritten if a full sync lands in the
        narrow window before MDBList's backend surfaces that same write back
        through this endpoint; that's a bounded, self-correcting risk (next
        sync repopulates it once MDBList catches up), the same risk profile
        already accepted for Simkl's removal reconciliation.

        This endpoint's response also carries "shows" and "seasons" buckets (per
        mdblist.apib) for bulk mark-watched actions taken on a whole show/season on
        MDBList's own site/app - MDBList has no per-episode record for those. Live-
        confirmed 2026-08-16 against a real account that these buckets are routinely
        populated, not an edge case (88 shows, 193 seasons, against 3427 individually-
        tracked episodes) - e.g. a 176-episode show bulk-marked watched as a whole,
        with only a handful of incidental season-0 specials individually tracked. A
        show/season bulk-marked that way contributes no local "episodes" rows, which
        surfaced as a stale/wrong "next episode" downstream (see
        mdblistMenus.Menus.next_up and its _expand_bulk_watched helper, which is what
        actually consumes bulk_watched_shows/bulk_watched_seasons below - this method
        only persists them). Reset+repopulated the same way as movies/episodes: a full
        DELETE, not a delta, since this is a complete paginated fetch of current server
        state each cycle."""
